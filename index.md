The key features are:

* **Data Import**: Read high resolution signals from local files, server or Physionet Database.
* **Data Pre-processing**: Outlier removal, noise filtering and missing value imputation.
* **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the imported signals using built-in features or user-defined features.
* **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: Build an automated pipeline for importing data, pre-processing and feature extraction.
* **Clustering**: Clustering, clusters robustness and stability evaluation, enrichment analysis and importnat features selection.
